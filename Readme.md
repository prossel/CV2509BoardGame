# Board Game

## Description

A simple 3D board game made with Unity. The player controls a ball that rolls around a board, trying to hit targets and avoid obstacles.

This game has been developed as part of the Applications Interactives course at HEAD-Gen√®ve.

The game is a work in progress and will probably never be finished. It has many bugs and is not optimized. It is not intended to be a commercial product. You can however still have fun playing it and testing it.

The current version can be played [here](https://prossel.github.io/CV2509BoardGame/).
